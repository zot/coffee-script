Bugs   

* mofor-do with filter needs to continue reducing

mofor game in
  game.fred()
  if game.yellow
  game.maluba()

currently does a forEach on the filtered results.  Needs to do a
   reduce, instead

Features

* functional version of coffeescript

* multiple assignment to a variable is an error

* properties can only be assigned in a constructor (and only once)

* "safe" version of for-loop for mapping, so i can't really change?:

      a = for i in x
        ...

becomes:

      a = []
      for (var j in x) (function(i){
        a.push(...)
      })(j)
